- Implementing a Stack Using Two Queues: Demonstrate how to simulate stack operations (push and pop) using two queue data structures. 
- Finding the First Missing Positive Integer in an Unsorted Array: Devise an efficient algorithm, ideally with O(n) time complexity, to identify the smallest missing positive number. 
- Reversing a Linked List: Explain both iterative and recursive approaches to reverse a singly linked list. 
- Validating Balanced Parentheses: Given a string containing various types of brackets (parentheses, curly braces, square brackets), determine if the string is valid by checking for properly closed and nested brackets.
