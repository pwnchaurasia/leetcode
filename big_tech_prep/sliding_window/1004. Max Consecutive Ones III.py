"""
when u encounter 0 decrement k
when k become less than 0
keep on checking if the leaving digit is 0
if its 0 increment k
and increment left 

length will be right - left + 1
+1 is there because array is zero indexing.
Without the +1, youâ€™d just get the distance between indices, 
not the count of elements in the window.
